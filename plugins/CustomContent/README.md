# MantisBT CustomContent Plugin

Copyright (c) 2017-2018, Ryadel - https://www.ryadel.com/

Released under the [GNU General Public License v3](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)

## Description

The **CustomContent** plugin can be used to include custom HTML, PHP, JS or CSS content within the MantisBT HTML layout structure.
It has been originally developed to provide a workaround for the [MantisBT bug #22098](https://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=22098),
based upon the fact that the `$g_top_include_page` and `$g_bottom_include_page` global variables are not supported / not working anymore (as of MantisBT 2.16.0, at least).


## Installation

1. Download this package as a single zip file & unzip it in the `/mantisbt/plugins/` folder of your current MantisBT installation.

2. Rename the resulting folder to `/CustomContent/`, so that the main plugin PHP file will have the following path: `/mantisbt/plugins/CustomContent/CustomContent.php`.

3. While logged into your Mantis installation as an administrator, go to **Manage** -> **Manage Plugins**.

4. In the **Available Plugins** list, you'll find the **CustomContent** plugin.

5. Click the **Install** button to install the plugin into your current MantisBT environment.

6. Navigate to the `/mantisbt/plugins/CustomContent/inc` folder and edit/modify the content files accordingly (see **Usage** below).

7. Open the `/mantisbt/config/config_inc.php` (the MantisBT configuration file) and add the following lines:

```php
# CustomContent Plugin settings
# ------------------------------------------------------

# this file will be included right before the closing <header> tag
$custom_head_file = "%absolute_path%/plugins/CustomContent/inc/custom_head_file.php";

# this file will be included right after the opening <body> tag
$g_custom_body_begin_file = "%absolute_path%/plugins/CustomContent/inc/custom_body_begin_file.php";

# this file will be included at the end of the header layout section, i.e. the main menu
$g_custom_page_header_file = "%absolute_path%/plugins/CustomContent/inc/custom_page_header_file.php";

# this file will be included at the end of the footer layout section, i.e the Mantis copyright
$g_custom_page_footer_file = "%absolute_path%/plugins/CustomContent/inc/custom_page_footer_file.php";

# this file will be included right before the closing <body> tag
$g_custom_body_end_file = "%absolute_path%/plugins/CustomContent/inc/custom_body_end_file.php";
```

Feel free to change the folders, paths & filenames accordingly to your needs.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: As of MantisBT 2.16.0, the `$custom_body_begin_file` is not working because of a bug in the current Mantis source code, which doesn't trigger the corresponding `EVENT_LAYOUT_PAGE_HEADER` hook. However, you can easily work around it through HTML injection using the HEADER insert point (which is working) and a simple JavaScript/JQuery script such as the following working examples:

```javascript
$(function() { 
    // insert brand/logo with link BEFORE the "MantisBT" text
    $('.navbar-container').prepend('<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand</a>'); 
    
    // insert additional content AFTER the "MantisBT" text
    $('.navbar-header').append('<p class="navbar-text">your custom content</p>'); 
    
    // ... and so on.
});
```

Check out the [Bootstrap 3 Navbar API](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar) for additional info on what you can do.

This arguably is the most "cleaner" approach until the MantisBT team will fix the source code.


## Usage
You can use the included files just any other PHP file: you can include PHP code, `<script>`, `<link>` and `<style>` elements to link external JS and CSS files or include internal code, images, text and so on.

**HINT**: this plugin can be used to bring back the MantisBT 1.x row-level coloring feature thanks to [this JQuery script](https://www.ryadel.com/en/mantis-bt-2-enable-row-level-coloring-like-v1-jquery-javascript/). Here's a screenshot showing the result:
